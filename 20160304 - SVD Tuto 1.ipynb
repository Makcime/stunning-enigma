    "When you browse standard web sources like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on Wikipedia, you find many equations, but not an intuitive explanation of what it is or how it works. Singular Value Decomposition is a way of factoring matrices into a series of linear approximations that expose the underlying structure of the matrix.\n",

For example, the PlayerAbility vector is modified so that the sum of the squares of its elements add to 1, instead of the current $1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3$. To do this, we have to divide each element by the square root of 3, so that when we square it, it becomes $1/3$ and the three elements add to 1. Similarly, we have to divide each HoleDifficulty element by the square root of 148. The square root of 3 times the square root of 148 is our scaling factor 21.07.
